## 📝 Notes

- Liquidity is currently reduced temporarily while an OpenBook market is being established to prevent early price manipulation.  
- Airdrops will be conducted from a separate wallet, not from the locked wallet, to maintain lock integrity.  
- Token ownership has been renounced and cannot be recovered — ensuring full decentralization.
